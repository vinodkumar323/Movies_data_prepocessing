->Movies Data Preprocessing
   This project is designed to provide a robust pipeline for cleaning, transforming, and preparing movies data for further analysis, machine learning, or 
   visualization tasks. The workflow covers various stages—from initial data exploration and cleaning to feature engineering and export of the refined dataset.
->Introduction
   In the era of big data, managing large datasets with varying formats and noise is crucial to drive reliable analysis. The Movies Data Preprocessing project 
   focuses on streamlining the process of data wrangling in the movie domain. It includes steps to:

   Import raw movie data from various sources.

   Clean data by handling missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent formatting.

   Transform data types and extract relevant features.

   Export data in a format ideal for further analysis or visualization.

   Whether you’re a data scientist, analyst, or developer interested in recommender systems, film analytics, or trend studies, this project offers a structured 
   approach to preprocess movie-related datasets efficiently.
->Pipeline Overview
   The preprocessing workflow involves the following key steps:

Data Ingestion:
  Import various data formats and merge sources as needed.

Data Cleaning:

  Handling missing values

  Removing duplicates

  Correcting inconsistencies (e.g., date formats, string formatting)

Data Transformation:

  Converting categorical data

  Feature extraction (e.g., extracting year from release dates)

  Normalizing numerical variables

Data Export:
  Save the cleaned and transformed data into the data/processed/ folder for downstream tasks.
